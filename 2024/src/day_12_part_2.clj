;; now, to represent a fence we are not going to use the [x y] pos of the fence (that could
;; overlap on thin inner spaces) but a triplet [x y DIR] 
;; - x , y : the pos of the plant int he region
;; - DIR : one of :up :down :left :right the direction pointing to the fence relatively to the plant
;;
;; for example : 
;; [0 0 :left]  => fence pos [-1 0]
;; [0 0 :right] => fence pos [1  0]
;; [0 0 :up]    => fence pos [0 -1]
;; [0 0 :down]  => fence pos [0  1]

;; If in a fence list we have : [0 1 :up] [1 1 :up] [2 1 :up]
;; ..then we have a side, horizontal, made of 3 fences
;; If we have [0 1 :down] [1 1 :down] [2 1 :down]
;; ... then we have a side, horizontal too, made of 3 fences
;; If we have : [1 0 :left] [1 1 :left]
;; ... then we have a side, vertical made of 2 fences

;; Wait, maybe something more simple. What if we set coordinates of a fence at - 0.25 or + 0.25 ?
;; For example 
;; [-0.25   0] left vertical fence
;; [ 0.25   0] right vertical fence
;; [ 0   0.25] bottom horizontal fence
;; [ 0  -0.25] top horizontal fence
