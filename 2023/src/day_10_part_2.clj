;; We must count how many tiles are enclosed in the loop

;; After some search I tought to implement a flood fill algorithm
;; - BFS
;; - fill tiles *outside* of the loop
;; There is however a particular condition that we must consider if we want to
;; flood fill all tiles *outside* of the loop and thaht is loop pipes sticked to the
;; edge of the grid.

;; Imagine this loop :
;; .....
;; .F-7.
;; .|.|.
;; .L-J.
;; .....

;; Starting from [0 0] flood fill will work well. But now what about with this loop :

;; .F-7.
;; .|.|.
;; .L-J.

;; There is no was that, starting from [0 0] we can end up filling the right most column 
;; simply because the algo will not access it.
;; One option would be to add a frame of tiles around the existing grid so to connect together
;; all outside regions.

  ;; Based on this post (https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/141460/how-can-i-fill-the-interior-of-a-closed-loop-on-a-tile-map)
  ;; we can try to scan each line of the grid and extract boundaries between external in internal network tiles.

  ;; result = 0
  ;; lineTileCount = 0
  ;; for each tiles of a given line (from left to right)
  ;;    if the tile belongs to the network
  ;;       if the tile is an horizontal pipe,
  ;;          just ignore it
  ;;       if the tile is a pipe (i.e no horizontal one) or 'S'
  ;;          store it in the boundaries list
  ;;    else, 
  ;;       if boundaries is not empty
  ;;           lineTileCount = lineTileCount + 1
  ;;    
  ;;    if the boundaries list contains 2 coords
  ;;       result = result + lineTileCount
  ;;       lineTileCount = 0
  ;;       clear boundaries list
