;; for each GAME, we get a HANDFUL of CUBES 
;; each Cube has one colors and possible colors are :
;; - red
;; - green 
;; - blue
;; Given a list of HANDFUL and given the number of cubes per color
;; in the bag, remove all impossible handful.

;; ðŸ˜­ ... wrong result (254)
;; let's analyze why is that. First, create some tests
;; humm ok i found what the proble is : I didn't read the description of the problem correctly
;; Each handful is composed of a "semicolon-separated list of subsets of cubes "
;; and the test on the numnber of count revealed apply on each subset independently and NOT on the wholme handful 
;; ðŸ¤“ ... next time I'll pay more attention to what I read.

;; better is to start all over again in day_2_read_again.clj
